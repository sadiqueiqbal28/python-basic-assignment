        "      - **Ample amount of libraries**: Python has nearly 1,00,000+ libraries for different use cases like django and flask for web development, numpy and panda for data science etc.\n",
        "      - **Easy to write and understand**: Python doesn't restrict for termination, It is an interpreted language which interprets line by line and understands itself where the statement has end. It supports indetation block which makes it look clean and optimised.\n",
        "      - **Cross Platform Compatibility**: Python can be executed on any platform like Windows, Macos, Linux.\n",
        "      - **Dynamically typed**: In python, we don't need to specify tha datatype before hand python variable takes input of any type of data despite of their nature.\n",
